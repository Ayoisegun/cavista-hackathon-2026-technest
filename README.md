# ElderCare AI: From Data to Prevention

A voice-first web-based health support system for elderly individuals that transforms daily interactions into preventive health insights.

**Theme:** Data and Prevention - AI as Your Health Partner

---

## The Problem
Elderly individuals face:
- Missed medications
- Undetected health decline
- Poor symptom reporting
- Delayed emergency response

Complex health apps fail because elderly users struggle with:
- Low digital literacy
- Poor eyesight
- Reduced motor skills
- Cognitive decline

---

## Our Solution
ElderCare AI combines:
- **Voice-first interaction** - natural communication
- **Minimal interface** - large buttons, no menus
- **Passive data collection** - no manual entry
- **AI analysis** - pattern detection and risk scoring
- **Caregiver alerts** - early intervention before crises

---

## Target Users
- **Primary:** Elderly individuals (60+) with limited tech experience
- **Secondary:** Caregivers and family members monitoring remotely

---

## Core Features

### 1. Medication Adherence Monitoring
- Voice/visual reminders
- Simple "Taken" or "Later" response
- Tracks missed doses and delay patterns
- Alerts caregiver when adherence drops

### 2. Daily Health Check-In
- Asks "How are you feeling today?"
- Options: Good, Okay, Not Well
- Detects declining health trends
- Alerts after multiple "Not Well" days

### 3. Inactivity Detection
- Monitors missed interactions
- Detects unusual silence
- Alerts caregiver to potential emergencies

### 4. Emergency Button
- One-tap activation
- Calls caregiver immediately
- Sends alert notification

---

## How It Works
1. Elderly user interacts via voice or simple taps
2. System logs all interactions
3. AI builds baseline and detects deviations
4. Risk alerts trigger caregiver intervention
5. Problems addressed before escalation

## Multilingual Support
- English
- Yoruba
- Igbo
- Hausa

Language selected during caregiver setup for natural voice interaction.

---

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Web app with voice input, high contrast UI, large buttons
- **Backend:** Authentication, data logging, alert system
- **AI Layer:** Pattern recognition, risk scoring, deviation detection

---

## MVP Scope (Hackathon Demo)
- Medication reminder + logging
- Exercise tracking
- Risk detection logic
- Caregiver dashboard
- Alert simulation
- Multilingual voice support

---

## Why This Fits the Theme
We collect daily interaction data → analyze patterns → trigger preventive interventions.

The AI acts as reminder, monitor, analyzer, and alert system - a true health partner focused on prevention, not just reaction.
